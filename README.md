# traker
<b>It makes tracking and image requests.</b><br/>
This is my second experience with map and tracking.<br/>
It uses API panoramio for image requests. (thank Jonas S. for the idea!)<br/>

it takes location. If the destantion more 100 meters, it makes request to image by location.
After this it save locations and image url (if it exist) in DB.<br/>
it also uses stratch UI  for all display size.
